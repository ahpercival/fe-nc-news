NC News is a news app that takes inspiration from the functionally of Reddit, by enabling users to join the user community, post news articles, leave comments, create new topics for discussion and up/down vote the articles and comments on the site.

The app was created in Node.js using React, reach/router, Netlify and Bootstrap, with some HTML and CSS on the frontend and Express, SQL, Chai, Mocha and Heroku on the backend.

To run the app locally you will need to folk/clone this repo, once downloaded, install dependencies using 'npm install'. To launch the app enter 'npm start' in your terminal to launch in your brower.

The API/backend can be found on this repo: https://github.com/ahpercival/nc_news_API.git
